Ever delete the sacred Default Cube by mistake? ðŸ˜±
Fear not â€” this addon brings it back with a Shift + A â†’ Mesh â†’ Default Cube option.

Itâ€™s like pressing Ctrl+Z, but with âœ¨ style âœ¨.

Why?

Because Blender isnâ€™t Blender without a Default Cube.
Use it to:

Summon a cube anytime, anywhere.

Repopulate the void after you yeeted the original.

Confuse your friends by making too many Default Cubes.

How to Use

Install addon (Edit â†’ Preferences â†’ Add-ons â†’ Installâ€¦).

Rejoice. ðŸŽ‰
